                <p>Purpose: <br>
                    The function can be used to analyze the general sentiment of input text (positive, negative, unclassified)

                    Describe:<br>
                    This service is based on nltk Vader functions.
                    VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool, it is used to quantify how much of positive or negative emotion the text has and also the intensity of emotion.
                    The service provides this last value, the intensity of the emotion.
                    On detail, it returns the compound, the most important measurement generated from the analysis.
                    Higher the compound, more positive is the string submitted.
                    In addition, the function set a threshold at compound equal to 0.5, if it is higher it states that the string has a positive sentiment, if it is lower it suggests a negative sentiment.
